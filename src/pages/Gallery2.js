    <h1>Downstate</h1>
    <p>This body of work was produced between 1974 and 1975 while living in Carterville, IL. It includes work done for a documentary on the local high school, several visits to Fred’s Dance Barn and people that I encountered around town. Selected images were printed and exhibited at Alibi Fine Art (“Downstate”) in January 2016.

    “I lived in Carterville for nearly ten years (1969 – 1978), but didn’t start photographing it until the mid-70s. I’d begun to consider it home by then, but still viewed it as a passing phase. A turning point.”
